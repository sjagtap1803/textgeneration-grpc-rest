## Text Generation Server
The server uses the 'distilgpt2' model from HuggingFace to perform text generation. In a new terminal, cd into this directory run the following command from your virtual environment to start the server.
```
$ python textgeneration_server.py
```
The server runs at `localhost:50051` by default.
